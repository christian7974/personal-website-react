        description: "When I am not programming or in school, I enjoy going to the gym and playing basketball. I'm a big sports fan, primarily following Boston teams. Baseball is my favorite sport to watch because of its leisurely pace and the unique atmosphere at the games. I also love to read and am currently reading <em>Atomic Habits</em> by James Clear."

        title: "Personal Background",
        description: "Being a first-generation college student meant that I couldn't ask my parents for guidance during my college journey. I had to figure things out myself and work extra hard on assignments—principles I apply to all aspects of my life. I enjoy figuring things out on my own and continuously learning new things. You can never know everything, but you can always strive to learn more."

        title: "Future Goals",
        description: "One of my future goals is to become a lead software engineer or project manager at a company. I often find myself leading group projects in school, even when it’s not by choice. I enjoy guiding a team and ensuring that everyone is on the same page so we can all reach our true potential. This is something I aspire to do on a larger scale in a professional setting. On a more personal note, I aim to learn Italian so that I can talk to my family when I visit."

        title: "Fun Facts",
        description: "I am a dual citizen of the United States and Italy. I visit Italy every year to see family, which is a big reason why I want to learn Italian. Besides Italy, I would love to travel to Switzerland. I visited Lake Lugano and was taken aback by its beauty; I want to go back and explore more places in Switzerland. My favorite place in the United States is Boston, as I have grown up near there my entire life, and I would love to work there one day."
